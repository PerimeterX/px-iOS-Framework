## Integration with the SDK

The SDK works by constantly profiling and evaluating device behavior to ensure that the connections to your mobile APIs and services are genuine.

This process is complex and detailed yet only requires initialization to manage a set of secure HTTP headers which are added to all HTTP and HTTPS requests made by the mobile application to the origin server. These HTTP headers are refreshed on a regular basis by the SDK as it is profiling the end-user’s mobile device.
